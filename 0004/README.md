# Median of Two Sorted Arrays
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively,
return the median of the two sorted arrays.
**The overall run time complexity should be O(log(m+n)).**

Example:
    Input:
        nums1 = [1, 3], nums2 = [2]
    Output:
        2.00000
    Explanation:
        merged array = [1, 2, 3] and median is 2.
