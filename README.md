# What is HacktoberFest?

Hacktoberfest is a month long event where people are awarded for contributing to open source projects üôå, and we're joining the party .Hosted by DigitalOcean for the 8th year in a row, Hacktoberfest encourages participation in giving back to the open source community by completing pull requests, participating in events, and donating to open source projects.

# More details

Hacktoberfest is open to everyone in our global community. Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned contributor or looking for projects to contribute to for the first time, you‚Äôre welcome to participate.

Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub or GitLab hosted repository/project. Look for the 'hacktoberfest' topic to know if a repository/project is participating in Hacktoberfest. Pull requests must be approved by a maintainer of the repository/project to count.

You can sign up anytime between October 1 and October 31. Just be sure to sign up on the official Hacktoberfest website for your pull requests to count.

# Rules for participation

* Pull requests can be submitted to any opted-in repository on GitHub or GitLab.
* The pull request must contain commits you made yourself.
* If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam, it will not be counted toward your participation in Hacktoberfest.
* If a maintainer reports behavior that‚Äôs not in line with the project‚Äôs code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.
* To get a shirt, you must make four approved pull requests (PRs) on opted-in projects between October 1-31 in any time zone.
* This year, the first 55,000 participants can earn a T-shirt.

# Quality Guidelines

* Pull requests that are automated e.g. scripted opening pull requests to remove whitespace / fix typos / optimize images.
* Pull requests that are disruptive e.g. taking someone else's branch/commits and making a pull request.
* Pull requests that are regarded by a project maintainer as a hindrance vs. helping.
* Something that's clearly an attempt to simply +1 your pull request count for October.
* Last but not least, one pull request to fix a typo is fine, but 5 pull requests to remove a stray whitespace is not.

### Note

**A pull request is considered approved once it has an overall approving review from maintainers, or has been merged by maintainers, or has been given the 'hacktoberfest-accepted' label. A pull request with any label containing the word 'spam' or 'invalid' will be considered ineligible for Hacktoberfest.**
