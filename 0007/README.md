# Reverse Integer

### Problem statemen
Given a signed 32-bit integer x, return x with its digits reversed. If reversing x causes the value to go outside the signed 32-bit integer range [-231, 231 - 1], then return 0.

**Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).**
